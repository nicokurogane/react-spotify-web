This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setting everything up

This App uses the [Spotify Web Api](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) to get the data
shown in the UI, so please refer to the documentation to get the credentials needed.

To run this project, you'll need to add an .env file to the root folder with the following variables:
REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE
REACT_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE
REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_BASE_URL=https://api.spotify.com/v1

after that you can run **yarn install** or **npm install**, then run **yarn start** or **npm start**
